# Purple Lotus
Project Lotus is a mental health website/desktop app focused around education.
It targets the AAPI community with an approach deeply rooted in psychology.
Project Lotus is currently in the early phase and is being built with React. 
The desktop app uses electron to build another easily accessible offline option.

Project Lotus is designed to assist in AAPI adults, AAPI children as well as therapists aiming to assist AAPI persons.
