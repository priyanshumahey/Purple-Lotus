            <h2>Preface</h2>
            <p>These modules are still early in development! 
                This current build is primarily for demonstration purposes and proof of concept!
                The current build is a stable build missing core features which will be present further on
                down the line. For now, feel free to explore the current version and enjoy the demo!
                The demo version only demonstrates Chinese Canadian youth and only has support for English
                and Mandarin. Future versions will include further language support, further culture support
                as well as more accessibility options and continued support for various groups.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This module would go over the issues of both parents and children and attempt to explain it with
                a therapy centered focus. The goal would be to teach therapists who may not have much knowledge
                about Asian cultures and help them gain a deeper understanding of the cultural aspects of different 
                Asian culutres.
