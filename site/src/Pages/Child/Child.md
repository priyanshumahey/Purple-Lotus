# For Youth

## Preface
These modules are still early in development! This current build is primarily for demonstration purposes and proof of concept! The current build is a stable build missing core features which will be present further on down the line. For now, feel free to explore the current version and enjoy the demo! The demo version only demonstrates Chinese Canadian youth and only has support for English and Mandarian. Future versions will include further langauge support, further culture support as well as more accessibility options and continued support for various groups.

## Overview
This module is focused on Chinese Canadian youth. This is meant to be a self-help module/guide built off of the shoulders of other Chinese Canadians to help walk through the commonly encountered mental health issues. 

This demo goes over 2 main topics. Feel free to pick and choose based on which one is most relevant to you.

1. Topic 1 will consist of going over the topic of name and identity. 
2. Topic 2 will go over the topic of food and lunches.

## Topic 1: Name and Identity
Hello! Welcome to topic 1! Name and identity are an important part of everyone's character and are highly important. For name and identity, this module will cover the following:
1. How you were given your name
2. The importance of name
3. The dual name citizenship
4. Forgoing your name
5. Immigrant experiences with name
6. Overview of mental wellness associated with name
7. Learning to accept your name

### How you were given your name
Names are a highly sacred thing in many cultures. In Chinese culture, names are special. Chinese families typically use two or more different syllables from the Chinese alphabet. They can then be combined and manipulated to create a highly unique and special name. This varies throughout different parts of China as there exists a large amount of diversity between the cultural groups and traditions in China.

Parents may often name their children based on wishes for their children, for instance names that include the terms for beauty, grace, and fortune. 

The way your parents named you was probably highly dependant on their values and the way that they were raised. If you don't know, go ahead and ask them about how they named you! Names are an important part of understanding yourself and your parents would definitely love to tell you more about how you were named! It's also a good bonding activity to understand why they decided your name to be what it is.

Chinese names are often unisex and are not often gendered unlike how many names in the West are. Chinese names are versatile and often lack the ability to be gendered. For last names, it is also a bit different from how it is done in the West. In the West, there are a huge variety of last names yet you may notice that Chinese last names tend to show a bit less variety. Surnames in many western regions may actually be derivede from professions or even used to distinguish people who had the same first names but needed to be distinguished between. In China, some surnames are highly common, for instance Wang, Chen and Zhao. Researchers believe this is do to the Galton-Watson process which is leading to name extinction. Rare and unpopular surnames face extinction due to the digital age and the evolving population. There have been numerous issues with needing to change surnames and accounting for the digital age and limited characters. Some surnames that relied on rarer characters may not be able to be digitalized and this can lead to surname extinction. 

 To learn more about your name and come to learn more about yourself, talk to your parents about your names and their names as well. 

### The importance of names

Names are important as they give us a sense of individuality and provide us a sense of who we are. They allow us to establish a sense of belonging and allow us to fit into communities. Having a name that's different from others may make us feel weird or out of place. Names have a lasting impact on a person and people associate themselves strongly with their name. 

As a Child, the importance of names is typically not there and many children get mocked for their unique or different names. When you were much younger, there is a chance that others pointed out that your name was different and this can lead to a feeling of getting "othered". Getting othered is the effect of being made to feel that someone is different from other people around them based on culture, langauge or even name.


Explain name based micro-aggressions.



### The dual name citizenship
For some Chinese people, they may have both a Chinese name and an English name. For some, their Chinese name may be their legal name and their English name may be their preferred name.


Shame that comes from ignoring one of their names

### Forgoing your name


### Immigrant experiences with name

### Overview of mental wellness associated with name
Name based micro-aggressions can lead to issues with belonging and feeling part of the community which can then lead to reduced mental wellness.  


### Learning to accept your name
Names are an important part of your identity. Whether you have one of them or two of them, or potentially even more, they are all


## Topic 2: Lunch
Another impactful topic for many, lunch can be a very concering time. Many Chinese people have had their food called disgusting or smelly. During lunch time, many Chinese youth have experienced bullying for their lunches and this has led many to feel othered and feel ashamed for their food. Sometimes this will lead Chinese youth to go eat their lunches away from others or not even eat their lunch in fear of judgement.


## Future goals

Going into the future, we will include more in depth guides on mental health and mental well being.
