# For Youth

## Preface
These modules are still early in development! This current build is primarily for demonstration purposes and proof of concept! The current build is a stable build missing core features which will be present further on down the line. For now, feel free to explore the current version and enjoy the demo! The demo version only demonstrates Chinese Canadian youth and only has support for English and Mandarian. Future versions will include further langauge support, further culture support as well as more accessibility options and continued support for various groups.

## Overview
This module is focused on Chinese Canadian youth. This is meant to be a self-help module/guide built off of the shoulders of other Chinese Canadians to help walk through the commonly encountered mental health issues. 

This demo goes over 2 main topics. Feel free to pick and choose based on which one is most relevant to you.

1. Topic 1 will consist of going over the topic of name and identity. 
2. Topic 2 will go over the topic of food and lunches.

## Topic 1: Name and Identity
Hello! Welcome to topic 1! Name and identity are an important part of everyone's character and are highly important. For name and identity, this module will cover the following:
1. How you were given your name
2. The importance of name
3. The dual name citizenship
4. Forgoing your name
5. The consequences of name
6. Immigrant experiences with name

### How you were given your name
Names are a highly sacred thing in many cultures. In Chinese culture, names are special. Chinese families typically use two or more different syllables from the Chinese alphabet. They can then be combined and manipulated to create a highly unique and special name. This varies throughout different parts of China as there exists a large amount of diversity between the cultural groups and traditions in China.

Parents may often name their children based on wishes for their children, for instance names that include the terms for beauty, grace, and fortune. 

The way your parents named you was probably highly dependant on their values and the way that they were raised. If you don't know, go ahead and ask them about how they named you! Names are an important part of understanding yourself and your parents would definitely love to tell you more about how you were named! It's also a good bonding activity to understand why they decided your name to be what it is.

Chinese names are often unisex and are not often gendered unlike how many names in the West are. Chinese names are versatile and often lack the ability to be gendered. For last names, it is also a bit different from how it is done in the West. In the West, there are a huge variety of last names yet you may notice that Chinese last names tend to show a bit less variety. Surnames in many western regions may actually be derivede from professions or even used to distinguish people who had the same first names but needed to be distinguished between. In China, some surnames are highly common, for instance Wang, Chen and Zhao. Researchers believe this is do to the Galton-Watson process which is leading to name extinction. Rare and unpopular surnames face extinction due to the digital age and the evolving population. There have been numerous issues with needing to change surnames and accounting for the digital age and limited characters. Some surnames that relied on rarer characters may not be able to be digitalized and this can lead to surname extinction. 

 To learn more about your name and come to learn more about yourself, talk to your parents about your names and their names as well. 

### The importance of names


Names are important as they give us a sense of individuality and provide us a sense of who we are. They allow us to establish a sense of belonging and allow us to fit into communities. Having a name that's different from others may make us feel weird or out of place.
