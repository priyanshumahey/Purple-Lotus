# For Therapists

## Preface
These modules are still early in development! This current build is primarily for demonstration purposes and proof of concept! The current build is a stable build missing core features which will be present further on down the line. For now, feel free to explore the current version and enjoy the demo! The demo version only demonstrates Chinese Canadian youth and only has support for English and Mandarian. Future versions will include further langauge support, further culture support as well as more accessibility options and continued support for various groups.
