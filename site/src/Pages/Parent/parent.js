            <h2>Preface</h2>
            <p>These modules are still early in development! 
                This current build is primarily for demonstration purposes and proof of concept!
                The current build is a stable build missing core features which will be present further on
                down the line. For now, feel free to explore the current version and enjoy the demo!
                The demo version only demonstrates Chinese Canadian youth and only has support for English
                and Mandarin. Future versions will include further language support, further culture support
                as well as more accessibility options and continued support for various groups.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This module would go over the issues parents may face in understanding mental health. 
                It will start off explaining mental health terminology in a comprehensive and easy to 
                understand method. It will also include in information that youth may face that parents may 
                not be aware of.
            </p>
            <p>
                The for parents side will also discuss therapy and will also include information about 
                the mental health of the parents themselves to get them to consider their own wellbeing. 
                This page will include more information, videos and there will be more language options present 
                on this page. It will be designed in a way to reduce stigma and increase the parents 
                understanding of mental wellbeing.
